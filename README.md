# Freeway
The program created was a remake of the atari videogame "Freeway". All the project was made with the learnigs of alura first steps's classes

## Rules:

You are a cow that needs to cross a highway. You control your cow with W (up) and S (Down). 
If you complete across, you'll return to your first position and be able to cross again.
If you have been ran over, you will restars the game in teh first position, losing 1 point of your score

Good Luck :)
